# Netflix-Content-Analysis
I analyzed the Netflix Titles dataset to uncover trends and insights about the platform's content. The dataset included information such as title, type (Movie or TV Show), release year, country, rating, and duration. Using Python and Matplotlib, I performed data cleaning to handle missing values and then created multiple visualizations. These included a bar chart comparing the number of movies and TV shows, a pie chart of content ratings, a histogram of movie durations, a scatter plot showing the number of releases by year, a bar chart of the top 10 content-producing countries, and line graphs showing the yearly trends of movies and TV shows released. The analysis revealed that movies dominate the platform, most content is rated for mature audiences, and the United States and India lead in content production. Over time, the volume of content especially TV shows has increased significantly. Based on these insights, I suggested that Netflix could improve its TV show segment by producing more regional and youth-friendly content, diversifying across more countries, and enhancing its content discovery and recommendation systems. This project helped me strengthen my skills in visualization, and generating actionable business insights from real-world datasets.
